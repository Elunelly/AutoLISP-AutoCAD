The LISP routines of this ZIP archive were created by Patrick Dewevre, also known as Patrick_35

Patrick left us in March 2019.

In agreement with his family, his work is made available here to the Autodesk community.


You can contact me about this but please note that I am not in charge of the maintenance and evolution of these programs.
